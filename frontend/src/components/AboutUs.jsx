      <p className="mb-8 py-4 text-xl">
        DriftOn started with a simple idea - making luxury car rentals easy and
        accessible for everyone. We believe that everyone deserves to experience
        driving a premium vehicle, whether it's for a special occasion or just
        because you want to treat yourself.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8 py-4 text-xl">
        We offer a wide selection of well-maintained luxury vehicles that you
        can book with just a few clicks. Our goal is to provide a hassle-free
        rental experience with transparent pricing and excellent customer
        service.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8 py-4 text-xl">
        What makes us different is our focus on quality and convenience. All our
        vehicles are regularly serviced and cleaned to ensure you get the best
        experience. We also offer professional drivers if you'd prefer to sit
        back and enjoy the ride.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8 py-4 text-xl">
        Thanks for considering DriftOn for your next journey. We look forward to
        serving you and exceeding your expectations.
